 📁 GitHub Repository Explorer 📂 🗂️
</p>
  
This project is a demo android app that connects to the GitHub API to show the list of public repositories in this GitHub account.

The challenge here is to **not** use external libraries, only the Android Support Library and unit testing libraries for Kotlin are used.
  
###### Technical details and used technologies
This project is written in Kotlin and uses Model-View-Presenter for better testability.

The app is built and unit tested with the help of Travis CI.
